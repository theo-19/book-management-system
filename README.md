Architecture & Notes

Frontend

Next.js 13 with the App Router for routing and layouts.

Server-Side Rendering (SSR) for both public catalog and admin list.

React Hook Form + Zod for form handling & validation.

React Query for client-side data caching and mutations.

MUI for styling, with custom theming and consistent design tokens.

Public vs. Admin layouts separated under app/ directory.

AuthContext for JWT token storage and route protection in client components.

Backend

NestJS framework with modular structure (AuthModule, UsersModule, BooksModule).

JWT authentication with Passport.js guards and a simple in-memory user store.

ZodValidationPipe for request validation (or fallback to Nestâ€™s ValidationPipe + DTOs).

In-memory storage for books (no external database). Simple array or JSON file.

Assumptions

Demo users are hardcoded in the backend (e.g., admin@example.com / password).

No persistent database: data resets on server restart.

Single admin role: no granular permissions beyond admin vs. public.

API URL is assumed to be http://localhost:3001; adjust NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL as needed.

For simplicity, error handling is minimal and focused on happy paths.
